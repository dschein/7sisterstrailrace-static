            An out-and-back roller coaster ride along the ridge line
            of the Mt. Holyoke Range on a single-track trail, with numerous scenic
            overlooks of the Pioneer Valley including views of the University of
            Massachusetts, Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the Town of
            Amherst, the Connecticut River and Northampton.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course is extremely hilly with 3,700 feet of climb
            consisting of many steep hills, with hazardous footing in places due to
            the many sharp basalt rocks that comprise the elevated ridge of the Mt.
            Holyoke Range.

          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>
            The first 7 Sisters Trail Race was a six-mile, one-way race from
            the Notch Visitors Center to Route 47 in Hadley. It followed almost the
            same out-route as the present race does, but was slightly different
            toward the finish as it went down closer to Route 47 instead of its
            present turnaround location near the home of Ted and Merle Buckhout, who
            graciously host our aid station at the 6-mile mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, the first &quot;race&quot; wasn&#39;t an official race as the
            State Warden in charge of the Mt. Holyoke State Park informed us prior
            to the start that we could not have a race on State property. &quot;No
            problem, we&#39; race was former UMass cross country and track star,
            Peter Crisci of Northampton.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensing some resistance on the part of the State to the continuation
            of the race, the 7 Sisters deteriorated to a postal competition that
            allowed participants to run the course at any time and report the time
            to the local running store, the runner&#39;shop in Northampton (owned by
            the race director at the time). Fortunately, one day the runner&#39;shop
            was visited by Jonathan Gottsche, an avid photographer and an officer of
            The Friends of the Holyoke Range, a non-profit organization dedicated to
            the preservation of the Range and the promotion of various activities on
            the Range, i.e., interpretive studies, concerts, hikes, bird watches,
            land acquisition, etc. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Jonathan was intrigued about the race and wanted to know more. Upon
            hearing that it wasn&#39;t welcomed as an official race anymore, he
            volunteered to bring the support of The Friends to the race, thus
            garnering official permission to stage the race. With that permission in
            place, the race was timed to co-ordinate with a trail breakfast that The
            Friends organized each spring and the distance was doubled, to twelve
            miles as an out-and-back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the 7 Sisters Trail Race is a fundraising event that benefits
            The Friends of the Holyoke Range. The 7 Sisters Trail Race has donated
            more than $10,000 during its existence. Those donations are made
            possible through your entry fees and the support and donations of gifts,
            T-shirts, and assistance from our sponsors. We thank everyone involved
            for helping us to preserve the trails that we love to run.
